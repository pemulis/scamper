Scamper is an AI agent whose goal is to identify scam tokens and protect crypto investors. This agent was built with a new framework that more closely integrates Coinbase AgentKit and OpenAI Agents SDK, adding out-of-the-box web search functionality, thread history, and a web API and frontend interface.
